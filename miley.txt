Hands in the air like we don't care.
'Cause we came to have so much fun now,

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell, no!"? (Hell no).
'Cause we're gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright.

I hopped off the plane at L.A.X.
with a dream and my cardigan.
Welcome to the land of fame excess (whoa).
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in the cab,
here I am for the first time.
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign.
This is all so crazy.
Everybody seems so famous.

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick,
too much pressure and I'm nervous.
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
and a Jay-Z song was on,
and a Jay-Z song was on.
And a Jay-Z song was on!

So I put my hands up, 
they're playing my song,
the butterflies fly away.
I'm noddin' my head like yeah.
Movin' my hips like yeah.
I got my hands up,
they're playin' my song,
I know I'm gonna be OK.
Yeah, it's a party in the USA.
Yeah, it's a party in the USA.

Get to the club in my taxi cab, 
everybody's looking at me now.
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town."

So hard with my girls not around me.
It's definitely not a Nashville party.
'Cause all I see are stilettos.
I guess I never got the memo.

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick.
Too much pressure and I'm nervous.
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune,
and a Britney song was on,
and a Britney song was on.
And a Britney song was on.

Feel like hoppin' on a flight, on a flight.
Back to my hometown tonight, town tonight.
Something stops me every time, every time.
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright.


We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain, 
we jumped never asking why.
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no one could deny.

Don't you ever say I just walked away.
I will always want you.
I can't live a lie, running for my life.
I will always want you.

I came in like a wrecking ball.
I never hit so hard in love.
All I wanted was to break your walls.
All you ever did was wreck me,
yeah, you, you wreck me.

I put you high up in the sky.
And now, you're not coming down.
It slowly turned, you let me burn
and now, we're ashes on the ground.

Don't you ever say I just walked away.
I will always want you.
I can't live a lie, running for my life.
I will always want you.

I came in like a wrecking ball.
I never hit so hard in love.
All I wanted was to break your walls.
All you ever did was wreck me.

I came in like a wrecking ball.
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung.
Left me crashing in a blazing fall.
All you ever did was wreck me,
yeah, you, you wreck me.

I never meant to start a war,
I just wanted you to let me in.
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win.
I never meant to start a war,
I just wanted you to let me in.
I guess I should've let you win.

Don't you ever say I just walked away.
I will always want you.

I came in like a wrecking ball.
I never hit so hard in love.
All I wanted was to break your walls.
All you ever did was wreck me.

Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung.
Left me crashing in a blazing fall.
All you ever did was wreck me.
Yeah, you, you wreck me,
yeah, you, you wreck me.
